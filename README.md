# MNP33FieldMaps
Field map for MNP33 and reading example

- This simple code reads the included map of the MNP33 dipole magnet, with a 5 cm grid spacing, and produces some basic histograms. The grid is defined in the intervals 0<x<300 cm, 0<y<300 cm, 0<x<500 cm. Only values for positive coordinates are given. It assumes symmetry around x=0,y=0,z=0

- The field map was created from an OPERA 3D simluation by Florian Stummer (CERN)
